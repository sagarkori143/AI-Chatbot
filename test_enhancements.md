# Testing Enhanced Weather Chatbot Features

## Test Cases for Enhanced Functionality

### 1. Dynamic City Detection
Test the bot's ability to extract city names from user queries:

**Test Queries:**
- "What's the weather in London today?"
- "How is the weather in New York?"
- "Tell me about the weather in Paris"
- "Tokyo weather forecast"
- "東京の天気はどうですか？" (Tokyo weather in Japanese)
- "दिल्ली में मौसम कैसा है?" (Delhi weather in Hindi)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Bot should automatically detect and use the mentioned city
- Should fetch weather data for the correct location
- Should not default to Tokyo unless no city is mentioned

### 2. Weather-Focused Conversations
Test that the bot stays on weather topics:

**Test Queries:**
- "Tell me about the stock market" (should redirect to weather)
- "What's your favorite movie?" (should redirect to weather)
- "How's the weather today?" (should provide weather info)
- "What should I wear in this weather?" (should provide weather-based advice)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Non-weather queries should be politely redirected to weather discussion
- Weather queries should receive detailed, conversational responses
- Responses should include precautions and safety advice

### 3. Multi-Language Response Generation
Test that responses are generated in all three languages:

**Test Queries:**
- "What's the weather like?" (in English)
- "天気はどうですか？" (in Japanese) 
- "मौसम कैसा है?" (in Hindi)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Response should include translations object with all three languages
- Language switching should work without additional API calls
- Each language should have native, non-translated content

### 4. Enhanced Weather Precautions
Test that responses include practical advice:

**Test Queries:**
- "Is it safe to go outside?" 
- "What should I wear today?"
- "Any weather warnings?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Responses should include specific clothing recommendations
- Safety precautions based on weather conditions
- Actionable advice for weather-appropriate activities

## API Response Structure

### New Enhanced Response Format:
```json

  "reply": "Primary response in detected language",
  "bullets": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2", "suggestion3"],
  "outfit": "Clothing advice",
  "safety": "Safety precautions", 
  "actions": [
    {"label": "Action", "detail": "Description"}
  ],
  "translations": {
    "ja": {

```

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash

2. **Open http://localhost:3000**

3. **Test City Detection:**
   - Type: "What's the weather in London?"
   - Verify: Bot fetches London weather, not Tokyo

4. **Test Multi-Language Responses:**
   - Send any weather query
   - Use language switching buttons
   - Verify: Instant switching without loading

5. **Test Weather Focus:**
